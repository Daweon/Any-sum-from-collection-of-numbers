# An aim of this program is to give all possibilities of getting sum of a certain value from a certain set of positive numbers. Set can be randomly generated from parameters given by user such as size of set and range of drawn numbers. User can give all numbers of set manualy aswell.

Single combination of numbers is called solution. The program gives two types of solutions: with and without repetitions. Solutions with repetitions mean that single element of set can be taken multiple times to combination of numbers which gives a sum. When user choose solutions without repetitions, every single element of set can be taken only once.

Number of solution is counted and all solutions are written in file solutions.txt.
